## Executive Summary

This white paper introduces **VEGAConfig** as a conceptual contribution within the Resonance Data and Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing (QIRC) paradigm.

VEGAConfig is not an implementation, algorithm, or product. It is a conceptual framework designed to extend the understanding of meaning, coherence, and temporal persistence in artificial systems.

---

## 1. Motivation

Current AI systems process information efficiently but cannot preserve insight or wisdom over time. VEGAConfig addresses this gap conceptually, without disclosing operational details.

---

## 2. Definition

**VEGAConfig** is defined as a conceptual construct within the Vega Continuum framework, representing a novel approach to resonance-based meaning systems.

---

## 3. What This Is

✔ Conceptual framework and definition  
✔ Contribution to resonance-based meaning systems  
✔ Part of the Vega Continuum and QIRC paradigm  
✔ Prior art establishment

---

## 4. What This Is NOT

✘ NOT an algorithm or implementation  
✘ NOT a claim of new physics or quantum hardware  
✘ NOT a claim of consciousness or sentience  
✘ NOT a product or commercial offering

---

## 5. VSP Compliance

This publication adheres to the **Vega Safety Protocol (VSP)**:

- Conceptual openness
